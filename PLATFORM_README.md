- 20251004000001_008_create_affiliate_system.sql
- 20251004000002_009_create_analytics_reviews_bundles.sql
```

### 2. Seed Data Required

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State**: React hooks and context

### Backend
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for assets)
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions

### Database Design Principles
- Single Responsibility: Each table has one clear purpose
- ACID Compliance: All transactions are atomic
- Row Level Security: User data is protected
- Auditing: Created/updated timestamps on all tables
- Performance: Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```
