---

## Backup & Recovery

### Automatic Backups
Supabase provides automatic daily backups with point-in-time recovery.

### Manual Backup
```bash
# Export schema
pg_dump -s [connection_string] > schema.sql

# Export data
pg_dump [connection_string] > full_backup.sql
```

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Database Size** - Track growth over time
2. **Query Performance** - Slow query logs
3. **Connection Pool** - Active connections
4. **RLS Policy Performance** - Query plan analysis
5. **Table Sizes** - Identify large tables
6. **Index Usage** - Unused indexes

### Recommended Tools
- Supabase Dashboard (built-in)
- pgAdmin for detailed analysis
- DataDog or similar for production monitoring

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Supabase Service Restoration**
   - Current status: ap-south-1 region temporarily unavailable
   - Check: https://status.supabase.com

2. **Apply Migrations** (Once service restored)
   ```bash
   # Migrations will auto-apply when service is back
   # Verify with: supabase migration list
   ```

3. **Verify Seed Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workflows;  -- Should be 350+
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents;     -- Should be 50+
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM assets;     -- Should be 200+
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM professional_tools;  -- Should be 8
   ```

4. **Test RLS Policies**
   - Test as anonymous user
   - Test as authenticated user
   - Test as admin user

5. **Configure Stripe**
   - Add Stripe secret keys to edge functions
   - Set up webhook endpoint
   - Test payment flows

6. **Production Launch**
   - Enable monitoring
   - Set up alerts
   - Document runbooks
   - Train support team
